                           Explanation of the Flowchart

Start: The process begins with the user accessing the Complaint Ticket App.

User Registration: Users (Admin, Normal User, Organization, or Agent) must register first.

User Login: After registration, users log in using JWT tokens for authentication.

User Role Check: The system checks if the logged-in user is an organization:

If Yes: The user can view complaints, review status, and generate reports.
If No: The normal user can submit a complaint.
Submitting a Complaint: Users fill out the complaint form with details such as 
category, description, attachments, organization to complain against, 
and priority level (Low, Medium, High, Urgent).

Submit Request: After submitting the complaint, the system processes the request.

View My Complaints: Users can view their submitted complaints and track their status.

Edit Profile: Users have the option to edit their profiles and update personal information.

Logout: Users can log out of the application.

End: The process ends after the user logs out.
